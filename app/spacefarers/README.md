# Galactic Spacefarer Adventure
Welcome to the Galactic Spacefarer Adventure project!

## Starting the generated app (make sure, you are using compatible browser)
- Open a new terminal and run `npm run watch-spacefarers`

## State of the challange
All tasks are ready, I was using my creativity and innovation with Data Model and Service Definition for the Spacefarers.

The backend is covered with unit tests. Altough draft mode handling is in progress state currently (tests which not prepared for draft mode are commented out yet.)

## Application Details
The application is prefilled with some user data for testing purposes. (Check db/data/*.csv for more details)
Also at the current development phase we are using mocked users for authorization, defined in the package.json file.

On GitHUB one can find a working pipeline for the application with test running and linting.
